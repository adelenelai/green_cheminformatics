I mostly work at the intersection of cheminformatics and environmental chemistry, which is what this blog will be about - hacks, thoughts, and then some.

I'm currently doing a joint/dual PhD at the [Environmental Cheminformatics](https://wwwen.uni.lu/lcsb/research/environmental_cheminformatics/research_projects) Group based at the [Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine](https://wwwen.uni.lu/lcsb), Luxembourg and the [Cheminformatics and Computatational Metabolomics](https://cheminf.uni-jena.de/) Group, based at [Friedrich Schiller University](https://www.uni-jena.de/), Germany.

Prior to this, I completed my [MSc. Environmental Sciences at ETH Zurich, Switzerland with a focus on Biogeochemistry and Pollutant Dynamics](https://ibp.ethz.ch/), and my [B.A. Chemistry at Wellesley College, USA](https://www.wellesley.edu/chemistry). At both ETH and Wellesley, I was fortunate to receive the [ETH Master's](https://ethz.ch/students/en/studies/financial/scholarships/excellencescholarship.html) and Gulick Farnsworth scholarships to support my respective studies.

I grew up in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia.
