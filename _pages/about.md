I work at the intersection of cheminformatics and environmental chemistry, which is what this blog will mostly be about - hacks, thoughts, and then some.

I'm currently doing a joint/dual PhD at the [Environmental Cheminformatics](https://wwwen.uni.lu/lcsb/research/environmental_cheminformatics/research_projects) Group based at the Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine, Luxembourg and the [Cheminformatics and Computatational Metabolomics](https://cheminf.uni-jena.de/) Group, based at Friedrich Schiller University, Germany. In my PhD, I develop software and workflows to analyse high-resolution mass spectrometry data.

I completed my [MSc. Environmental Sciences](https://ibp.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich, Switzerland, where I was awarded the [ETH Master's Scholarship](https://ethz.ch/students/en/studies/financial/scholarships/excellencescholarship.html). Prior to that, I graduated *magna cum laude* with a  [B.A. Chemistry](https://www.wellesley.edu/chemistry) from Wellesley College, USA, where I received the Gulick Farnsworth scholarship award.

I grew up in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia.
