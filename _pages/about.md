I mostly work at the intersection of cheminformatics and environmental chemistry, which is what this blog will be about - hacks, thoughts, and then some.

I'm currently doing a double PhD at the [Environmental Cheminformatics](https://wwwen.uni.lu/lcsb/research/environmental_cheminformatics/research_projects) Group based at the [Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine](https://wwwen.uni.lu/lcsb), Luxembourg and the [Cheminformatics and Computatational Metabolomics](https://cheminf.uni-jena.de/) Group, based at [Friedrich Schiller University](https://www.uni-jena.de/), Germany.
